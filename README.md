# Treasury Yield Analysis

This repository contains code for analysing and predicting 10-year Treasury Yields using machine learning techniques. The project encompasses a comprehensive ETL process, data aggregation, behavioural analysis, analytics automation, and performance optimisation.

## Project Description

This project involves the following steps:
1. **ETL Process Automation**: Extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources to streamline data pipelines.
2. **Data Aggregation and Simplification**: Develop new aggregated views and tables to simplify data querying and facilitate informed decision-making processes.
3. **Behavioural Liquidity and Cash Flow Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analyses of behavioural liquidity patterns and cash flow dynamics.
4. **Ad-Hoc Performance Enhancements**: Analyse and implement ad-hoc performance enhancements to adapt liquidity and risk management strategies effectively.
5. **Analytics Automation**: Automate analytics tasks using machine learning algorithms and predictive modelling techniques.
6. **Model-Based Performance Optimisation**: Optimise performance across various metrics using sophisticated modelling techniques.
